Autowiring in Spring


⦁ Feature of Spring Framework in which spring container inject the dependencies automatically.
⦁ In past scenarios, we manually inject the dependencies in the xml file
⦁ Autowiring can’t be used to inject the primitive and String values. It works with reference only.
⦁ It is important that Class is dependent on other class
