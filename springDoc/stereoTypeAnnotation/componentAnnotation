1. As of now, we are creating bean in config.xml file, which tell the spring container that he has to
create the bean of that class.
2. Now We will not add the <bean> tag in the config.xml file.
3. We will use the @Component tag in top of class like below example

@Component
class Person {


}

4. When we will apply the @Component annotation, then the spring container will automatically get to know
that he has to create the bean of that class
5. But we have to add the below line in config.xml
<context:component-scan base-package=""/>

6. We will add the package in the double quotes
