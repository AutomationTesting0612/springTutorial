1. When we have two bean of same name of Address class in config.xml, then spring
throws the exception as "No qualifying bean of type 'org.spring.annotation.autowire.AddressClass' available:
expected single matching bean but found 2: address2,address1"

2. We can fix tis issue by adding @Qualifier annotation with @Autowired annotation
3. The Syntax is @Qualifier("address1")
